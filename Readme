Functions exercise, procedure, java

1 we create a function that, passing the name and surname of a living author, returns the age (number of years)
get_age_by_author

2 we create a procedure get_age_authori_nazione(in varcharnation)
which returns a list of authors (name, surname, age) of the country indicated as a parameter
and inserts them into a table autore_eta_temp table. (name varchar, surname int age, today_date).
Logically it will create the table or drop the table at the beginning.

3 create java main class which calls the procedure and stores the data obtained in a list which then prints the authors sorted by decreasing age on the screen.

4 Create sql to recreate the author table(â€¦), insert the records into the author table, create the function, create the procedure.

5 (optional) you want to automate the launch of the main java program call by calling a LaunchProceduraJava.bat file every day at 10.00 in the morning on your machine (create Windows activity)
